# Overview

### Description

I created a book shop inventory of books that are being sold at a book shop. The list
includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a
customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system
searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests
for the number of copies required. If the requested copies book details and requests
for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost
of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message “Required copies not in
stock” is displayed.

The purpose of this software was mainly to train me in the language of C++ to develop my skills as a programmer

# Development Environment

This software was developed using VSC

The programming language is C++ and the following libraries were used:
iostream
string.h
standard c++ library

# Useful Websites

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
* [STL Containers](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: create an function that accesses a database to see if the customer already has a library card and does not need to pay for the book they want
* Item 2: Make the program more user friendly
